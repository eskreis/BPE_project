AI model to categorize BPE on breast MRI

Breast MRI background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) conveys information both about a patient’s risk of having breast cancer and about a radiologist’s risk of missing that cancer. BPE assessments by radiologists are subjective and prone to both inter- and intra-reader variation, which stymies efforts to use BPE as a clinical tool or imaging biomarker.

A DL model with VGG19 architecture was trained to classify breast MRI into the  BPE categories using BPE labels from radiology reports as the reference standard.
